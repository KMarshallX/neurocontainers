## xcpd/0.10.5 ##

XCP-D (eXtensible Connectivity Pipeline for DCAN-labs) aims to provide a robust and modular implementation of the most commonly used resting-state fMRI preprocessing steps. It adapts parts of the DCAN Labs processing pipeline to BIDS specifications and extends functionality of existing fMRI processing tools.

To run container outside of this environment: ml xcpd/0.10.5
