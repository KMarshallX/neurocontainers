  ## fitlins/0.11.0 ##

  FitLins is a tool for estimating linear models, defined by the BIDS Stats-Models specification proposal, to BIDS-formatted datasets.

  FitLins is developed against fMRIPrep-preprocessed datasets, but is intended to work with any dataset following the BIDS Derivatives draft specification.

  Example:
  ```
  fitlins data/bids_root/ out/ participant -d data/derivatives/fmriprep/ -w work/
  ```
